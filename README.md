#### An ITP (NYU) project by Mint Woraya Boonyapanachoti & Dror Ayalon


### Overview
The Video Machine is a video controller, powered by an Arduino, that controls the playback of videos presented on a web browser.
By pressing a button on the controller, the correlated video is being played on the screen and heard through the speakers.  
Videos are being played in an infinite loop.  
Only the videos that are being played, are being heard.

### Functionality
On its first version, The Video Machine controller offers three functions:
- **Volume** - Affects the volume of the selected video.
- **Cut** - Trims the length of the selected video.
- **Speed** - Changes the speed of the selected video.
