# NamNam: The Video Machine (version 2.0)
#### An ITP (NYU) project by Mint Woraya Boonyapanachoti & Dodi Dror Ayalon


### Overview

NomNom: The Video Machine allows you to play videos as music samples, and sync them like a DJ.  

Powered by an Arduino, NomNom controls the playback of videos presented on a web browser.  
By pressing a button on the controller, the correlated video is being played on the screen and heard through the speakers.  
The videos are being played in sync with one another.  
Only the videos that are being played, are being heard.  

### Functionality
On its first version, The Video Machine controller offers three functions:
- **Steps** - Affects The number of times a video is being played during a single loop (1-4 times).
- **Volume** - Affects the volume of the selected video.
- **Cut** - Trims the length of the selected video.
- **Speed** - Changes the speed of the selected video.
